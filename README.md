# Customize for Psychoanalyze

## Creation
Since this quiz is very JavaScript heavy, I initially struggled to get the syntax right to accomplish what I wanted. However, after reading more jQuery documentation, manipulating CSS became easy breezy. I selected using both vanilla JavaScript and jQuery, finding the latter to be the cleaner and easier option. This quiz was very fun to create since I focused on JavaScript effects, hope you have fun too and don't take the results seriously!

## Highlights
The quiz starts off (seemingly) unstylized, but clicking answers to a question changes its appearance

So many things are customizable!! Go crazy!!

The selection animations are also designed to be as annoying as possible, to force out your TRUE PERSONALITY.

Thanks for quizzing!
