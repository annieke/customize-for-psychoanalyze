## Creation

Since this quiz is very JavaScript heavy, I initially struggled to get the syntax right to accomplish what I wanted. However, after reading more jQuery documentation, manipulating CSS became easy breezy. I selected using both vanilla JavaScript and jQuery, finding the latter to be the cleaner and easier option. This quiz was very fun to create since I focused on JavaScript effects, hope you have fun too and don't take the results seriously!
